# FlashForge - GitHub Solutions Engineer Vocabulary Study Platform

A modern, Anki-inspired flashcard application designed to help GitHub Solutions Engineers master technical vocabulary through spaced repetition and effective study sessions.

**Experience Qualities**:
1. **Focused** - Clean, distraction-free interface that promotes deep learning and retention
2. **Intuitive** - Self-explanatory navigation and study flow that feels natural from first use
3. **Efficient** - Quick card creation, editing, and study sessions that respect the user's time

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
The app manages multiple decks, study sessions, and progress tracking with persistent state but remains focused on core flashcard functionality without advanced analytics or social features.

## Essential Features

**Deck Management**
- Functionality: Create, edit, and organize vocabulary decks by category
- Purpose: Organize study material into logical groups for focused learning

**Card Study Session**
- Functionality: Present cards one at a time with reveal mechanism and difficulty rating
- Purpose: Active recall practice with spaced repetition principles
- Trigger: Select deck and click "Study Now"
- Progression: Show term → Think → Reveal definition → Rate difficulty → Next card → Session complete
- Success criteria: Cards are shuffled, progress is tracked, difficulty affects future card frequency

**Card Creation & Editing**
- Functionality: Add new cards or modify existing ones within decks
- Purpose: Maintain and expand vocabulary knowledge base
- Trigger: "Add Card" button in deck view or edit existing card
- Progression: Enter term → Enter definition → Save → Return to deck view

## Edge Case Handling

**Empty Deck Study**: Show friendly message with option to add cards instead of empty study session
**Deck Deletion**: Confirmation dialog prevents accidental loss of study progress
**Long Definitions**: Text wraps gracefully and cards expand to accommodate content
**No Decks Available**: Onboarding flow guides user to create first deck with sample content

## Design Direction

The design should feel clean, professional, and focused like a premium study tool. It should evoke the calm concentration of a well-organized library while maintaining the efficiency of modern productivity software. Minimal interface design better serves the core purpose by eliminating distractions during study sessions.

## Color Selection

Triadic color scheme using three equally spaced colors to create visual distinction between different interface sections while maintaining harmony.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (oklch(0.4 0.15 240)) - Communicates trust, focus, and professionalism suitable for learning
- **Secondary Colors**: 
  - Warm Orange (oklch(0.65 0.15 60)) - For progress indicators and positive actions
  - Forest Green (oklch(0.5 0.12 120)) - For success states and completed items
- **Accent Color**: Bright Orange (oklch(0.7 0.2 50)) - For call-to-action buttons and important interactions
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (White oklch(1 0 0)): Dark Blue text (oklch(0.2 0.1 240)) - Ratio 12.1:1 ✓
  - Card (Light Gray oklch(0.98 0.01 240)): Dark Blue text (oklch(0.2 0.1 240)) - Ratio 11.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue oklch(0.4 0.15 240)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 6.2:1 ✓
  - Accent (Bright Orange oklch(0.7 0.2 50)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should convey clarity and readability while maintaining a modern, professional appearance suitable for technical vocabulary study.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (App Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Deck Names): Inter Semibold/24px/normal letter spacing  
  - H3 (Card Terms): Inter Medium/20px/normal letter spacing
  - Body (Definitions): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height
  - UI Labels: Inter Medium/14px/normal letter spacing

## Animations

Animations should feel purposeful and educational, reinforcing the learning process through smooth transitions that guide attention without becoming distracting.
